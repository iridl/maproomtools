Instructions for Harvesting the RDFa Terms from the Maproomscrape

1) Pull out the mappage terms for title, description, and isDescribedBy
by running the construct query, mappage_rdfa.serql, on iridlc:8180 
maproomscrape2-owl using the openrdf-workbench interface (this process can
be put in a script)

# save the results as rdf/xml and give it the name mappages.xml

2) Use the xslt-transform, mappage.xslt, to create xhtml that can be cut
and pasted into the mappages that are being converted to contain rdfa for
the new maproom.

xsltproc mappage.xslt mappages.xml > mappages.xhtml
