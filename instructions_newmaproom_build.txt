	Instructions for Building up New Maproom from Leaf Mappages

1) Make sure that leaf mappages (i.e. lowest level mappage in a maproom
subdir) can be parsed by running rdfalint.pl on each mappage

2) Generate maproom registry of all mappages that have rdfa content with gen_registry.pl
# run this in the ingrid/maproom dir
# output is the maproomregistry.owl file needed for generatentriples
# there are no arguments to this script

3) Create RDF/XML triples from the rdfa content of all the mappages listed in maproomregistry.owl
with runnewmaproom
# this must be run in the directory that has all the maproom subdirs, 
# like /data/jdcorral/iri_html/ingrid/maproom
# triples are stored in newmaproom-owl on http://iridlc6.ldeo.columbia.edu:8380/openrdf-sesame

4) Building index page from leaf pages

Run generatentriples.jar on triple store repository for maproom pages
(iridlc6:8380 newmaproom-owl) to create the file 'tabs.xml' with runconstruct

Use xsltproc to read the index.xhtml.xx stub and create the index.html.xx file(s)
Presently, you have to copy tab.xslt from maproomtools to the directory where you run the
following commands
xsltproc tab.xslt index.xhtml.en > index.html.en
xsltproc tab.xslt index.xhtml.es > index.html.es
