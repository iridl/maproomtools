	Instructions for Building up New Maproom from Leaf Mappages

1) maproomtools/rdfalint.pl
 
Make sure that leaf mappages (i.e. lowest level mappage in a maproom
subdir) can be parsed by running rdfalint.pl on each mappage

2) maproomtools/gen_registry.pl

Generate maproom registry of all mappages that have rdfa content with gen_registry.pl
# Run this in the ingrid/maproom dir
# Output is the maproomregistry.owl file needed for generatentriples
# There are no arguments to this script; maproomregistry.owl is created in the ingrid/maproom dir
# The namespace for maproomregistry must point to the actual file or URL location of the 
# maproomregistry.owl file

3) maproomtools/runnewmaproom

Create RDF/XML triples from the rdfa content of all the mappages listed in maproomregistry.owl
with runnewmaproom
# This must be run in the directory that has all the maproom subdirs, 
# like /data/jdcorral/iri_html/ingrid/maproom
# Triples are stored in newmaproomcache/owlimMaxRepository.trig

4) maproomtools/maproom_section_index.serql

Building index page from leaf pages by creating the file 'tabs.xml' as
the second part of maproomtools/runnewmaproom with maproomtools/maproom_section_index.serql.
The namespace declaration for maproomregistry must be the same as the one
used in maproomtools/tab.xslt

4) maproomtools/tab.xslt

Use saxon to read the index.xhtml.xx stub and create the index.html.xx file(s)
Presently, you have to copy tab.xslt from maproomtools to the ingrid/maproom

java -jar ~jdcorral/xmldocs/workspace/olfs/lib/saxon-9.1.0.5.jar IFRC/index.xhtml.en tab.xslt > IFRC/index.html.en
java -jar ~jdcorral/xmldocs/workspace/olfs/lib/saxon-9.1.0.5.jar IFRC/index.xhtml.es tab.xslt > IFRC/index.html.es
